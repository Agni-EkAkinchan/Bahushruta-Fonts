This is an attempt to create 'bahushruta' fonts for Indian languages.
As I started, wasnt sure if more than a POC like output was possible, but this is fairly usable now.

Bahushruta Devanagari includes below scripts so far.
Odia
Kannada
Gujarati
Gurumukhi
Tamil
Telugu
Bengali
Malayalam

Note that current output is NOT expected to be nearly problem free but for most part, apart from some still remaining matra alignment issues. it is expected to give reasonable output. (Malayalam may need more feedback and may have some mis-mappings as of now.)

-----------------------------------------------
Bahushruta Kannada
covers Devanagari, Telugu, Gujarati.
I think it is mostly problem free for these three scripts.

----------------------------------------------------
to use,
go to page of lipi of your choice, download (right click, save link as) and install ttf file, in chrome->setting->appearance->customise fonts-> choose bahushruta devanagari for standard and sans serif

If updating, close all instances of browser before installing newer file. (if not done, new file wont show effect till computer is restarted)
